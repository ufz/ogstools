How to work with FEFLOW data in pyvista.
========================================

.. sectionauthor:: Julian Heinze (Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research GmbH - UFZ)

In this example we show how a simple FEFLOW model consisting of two layers can be converted to a pyvista.UnstructuredGrid.
"""

# %%
# 1. Let us convert only the points and cells at first.
import ifm_contrib as ifm

import ogstools.meshplotlib as mpl
from ogstools.feflowlib import (
    read_geometry,
    update_geometry,
)
from ogstools.feflowlib.examples import path_2layers_model

# Load a FEFLOW model (.fem) or FEFLOW results file (.dac) as a FEFLOW document.
feflow_model = ifm.loadDocument(path_2layers_model)
pv_mesh = read_geometry(feflow_model)
pv_mesh.plot(show_edges=True, off_screen=True)
# %%
# 2. To this mesh we add point and cell data.
pv_mesh = update_geometry(pv_mesh, feflow_model)
pv_mesh.plot(scalars="P_HEAD", show_edges=True, off_screen=True)
# Print information about the mesh.
print(pv_mesh)
# %%
# 3. As the FEFLOW data now are a pyvista.UnstructuredGrid, all pyvista functionalities can be applied to it.
# Further information can be found at https://docs.pyvista.org/version/stable/user-guide/simple.html.
# For example it can be saved as a VTK Unstructured Grid File (\*.vtu).
# This allows to use the FEFLOW model for ``OGS`` simulation or to observe it in ``Paraview```.
pv_mesh.save("2layers_model.vtu")
# %%
# 4. As the converted mesh is a pyvista.UnstructuredGrid, we can plot it using meshplotlib.
fig = mpl.plot(pv_mesh.slice_orthogonal(), "P_HEAD")
