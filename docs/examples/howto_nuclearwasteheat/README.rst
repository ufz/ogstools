Using proxy models for nuclear waste heat production
====================================================

The following jupyter notebook shows some example usage of the ```nuclearwasteheat``` submodule.
In the context of OGS, this submodule is meant to provide an easy way to calculate
the heat generated by nuclear waste repositories, to apply it in a simulation as
the source term for the temperature process variable.
