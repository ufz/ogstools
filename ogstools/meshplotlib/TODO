* pinpoint the limits in the plot
* improve the colormap handling, especially the custom colormap for temperature
* skip overlapping layer boundaries
* alternative to pyvista native isometric plot (hassle with dependencies and docker container)
* get rid of scipy dependency (only needed for griddata)
