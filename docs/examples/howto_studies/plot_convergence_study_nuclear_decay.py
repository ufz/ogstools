Convergence study (temporal refinement)
=======================================

This example shows one possible implementation of how to do a convergence study
with temporal refinement. For this, a simple model using a time dependent heat
source on one side and constant temperature on the opposite side was set up.
The heat source is generated with the
:py:mod:`ogstools.physics.nuclearwasteheat` model.

Here is some theoretical background for the topic of grid convergence:

`Nasa convergence reference
<https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/wind/valid/tutorial/spatconv.html>`_

`More comprehensive reference
<https://curiosityfluids.com/2016/09/09/establishing-grid-convergence/>`_

At least three meshes from simulations of increasing temporal refinement are
required for the convergence study. The topology has to stay the same.

The results to analyze are generated on the fly with the following code. If you
are only interested in the convergence study, please skip to
`Temperature convergence at maximum heat production (t=30 yrs)`_.

First, the required packages are imported and an output directory is created:

#
# The grid convergence at this timepoint deviates significantly from 1,
# meaning the convergence is suboptimal (at least on the left boundary where the
# heating happens). The chosen timesteps are still to coarse to reach an
# asymptotic rate of convergence. The model behavior at this early part of the
# simulation is still very dynamic and needs finer timesteps to be captured with
# great accuracy. Nevertheless, the maximum temperature converges (sublinearly)
# from overestimated values, as expected.

# The temperature convergence at this timepoint is much closer to 1, signifying
# a good convergence behaviour. The temperature gradient at this point in time
# is already settled and can be the solution convergences to a good degree with
